# Weather Dashboard

* This weather dashboard was created for users who wish to know the current weather, as well as for the following five days, for certain cities. 
* I made this weather dashboard dynamic by requesting data from third-party APIs and using JavaScript to render a one-glance weather report to the user.
* The dashboard is able to remember prior cities search and list them on a sidebar so they can be clicked and reviewed at a later time -even after refreshing the page.
* Although the dasboard is concise, it provides the temperature in Fahrenheit, date, humidity, wind speed, color coded UV index, and graphic representations for both, the current weather and 5-day forecast displays.
* The color represention of the UV index conditions have the following meaning: green: low, orange: medium, red: high, and violet:very high.
