# Weather Dashboard

* This weather dashboard was created for users who wish to know the current weather, as well as for the following five days, for certain cities. 
* I made this weather dashboard dynamic by requesting data from third-party APIs and using JavaScript to render a one-glance weather report to the user.
* The dashboard is able to remember prior cities search and list them on a sidebar so they can be clicked and reviewed at a later time -even after refreshing the page.
* Although the dasboard is concise, it provides the temperature in Fahrenheit, date, humidity, wind speed, color coded UV index, and graphic representations for both, the current weather and 5-day forecast displays.
* The color represention of the UV index conditions have the following meaning: green: low, orange: medium, red: high, and violet:very high.


whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
WHEN I open the weather dashboard
THEN I am presented with the last searched city forecast
```
